# Playwright Automation Framework

A comprehensive UI automation framework built with Playwright and JavaScript, implementing Page Object Model (POM) design pattern for testing the Pointr blog website. This framework validates article loading and performs word frequency analysis on the latest blog articles.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This automation framework fulfills the following requirements:
1. **Blog Validation**: Verifies that all articles on https://www.pointr.tech/blog have loaded correctly
2. **Word Frequency Analysis**: Extracts and analyzes the most repeated 5 words from the latest 3 articles
3. **Multi-Browser Support**: Supports Chromium, Firefox
4. **Page Object Model**: Implements clean, maintainable POM design pattern
5. **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions

### Page Object Model Design

The framework implements a clean POM architecture:

- **BasePage**: Contains common functionality shared across all pages
- **BlogPage**: Handles blog listing page interactions and article discovery
- **ArticlePage**: Manages individual article content extraction and analysis
- **WordAnalyzer**: Utility class for text processing and frequency analysis
- **TestHelpers**: Common helper functions for file operations and test utilities

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn package manager
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>

# Run with debug mode
npm run test:debug
```
#

## 📊 Test Results

### Output Files

The framework generates several types of output:

1. **Word Frequency Results** (`test-results/word-frequency-results.txt`)
   - Contains the top 5 most repeated words from the latest 3 articles
   - Includes word counts and article metadata

2. **HTML Test Report** (`playwright-report/index.html`)
   - Interactive test execution report
   - Screenshots and videos of test failures
   - Detailed test step information

3. **Screenshots** (`screenshots/`)
   - Page screenshots for verification
   - Failure screenshots for debugging

## 🔄 CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions

The framework includes a comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) that:
- Runs tests on push and pull requests
- Supports manual execution with browser selection
- Generates and publishes test reports
- Archives word frequency analysis results


**Usage:**
```bash
# Trigger manual workflow
gh workflow run ci.yml -f browser=chromium -f test_pattern="word frequency"

```
